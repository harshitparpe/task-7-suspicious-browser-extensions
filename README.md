# Task 7 - Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

Elevate Labs Internship

## Objective

To review browser extensions for suspicious behavior, evaluate permissions, and remove any that may pose a security or performance risk.

## Steps Performed

1. Opened Chrome extensions manager via chrome://extensions.
2. Reviewed all installed extensions:
   - Checked developer authenticity
   - Evaluated permissions and user reviews
   - Researched lesser-known extensions online
3. Identified and removed potentially risky or unnecessary ones.
4. Captured screenshots before and after removal.

## Extensions Evaluated

| Extension Name          | Status  | Notes                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| AdBlock                 | Kept    | Trusted and widely used                    |
| Google Docs Offline     | Kept    | Official Google extension                  |
| McAfee WebAdvisor       | Removed | Unused, some reports of performance issues |
| Rotten Tomato Destroyer | Removed | Unknown origin and not required            |
| Unhook                  | Kept    | Helpful for YouTube distraction blocking   |
